# Interactive Map of German Air Quality (PM2.5)

### ‚û°Ô∏è [**View the Live Demo Here!**](https://hossein-zamaninasab.github.io/Interactive-German-Map/)

This is a web-based, interactive choropleth map that visualizes the average annual PM2.5 air pollution levels across the 16 federal states of Germany. The project demonstrates the process of fetching, cleaning, processing, and visualizing real-world environmental data.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Interactive Choropleth Map**: States are color-coded based on their average PM2.5 levels, making it easy to spot regional differences.
-   **Data-driven Styling**: The color scale is dynamically applied based on the values in the processed dataset.
-   **Interactive Tooltips**: Hovering over a state highlights its borders.
-   **Informative Popups**: Clicking on a state reveals a popup with its name and exact average PM2.5 value.
-   **Live Demo**: The project is deployed using GitHub Pages for easy access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Libraries

-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
-   **Mapping Library**: [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
-   **Data Handling**: [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) - Used for efficiently loading and parsing the CSV data file.
-   **Data Processing**: The raw data was cleaned and aggregated manually using Microsoft Excel's PivotTable functionality.

## üìä Data Source

The air quality data used in this project is official data from the German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt - UBA).

-   **Primary Source**: [UBA Air Data Portal - Annual Reports (Jahresbilanzen)](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/daten/luft/luftdaten/jahresbilanzen-luftqualitaet)
-   **Geospatial Data**: The GeoJSON file for German state boundaries was sourced from the [GeoBoundaries dataset](https://github.com/geoboundaries/germany).
